# This Streamlit web application leverages OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate threat models for given applications using the STRIDE methodology. Cyber security professionals can provide application descriptions and key details, such as the application type, authentication methods, and whether the application is internet-facing or processes sensitive data. Upon submission, the LLM generates a threat model based on the provided details.

# The app layout includes input fields for the application details, a submit button, and a sidebar with helpful information, such as how to use the app, an example application description, and FAQs. Users can generate a threat list and/or attack tree visualisations for their applications. The app also includes options to download the generated threat model and attack tree as Markdown files.

# Features:
# - Application description input field
# - Selectable application type, authentication methods, internet-facing status, sensitive data level, and privileged access management status
# - Generate threat model and attack tree based on user input
# - Display generated threat model and attack tree in the app
# - Generate potential mitigations for identified threats
# - Download threat model, attack tree and mitigations as Markdown files
# - Sidebar with helpful information, such as how to use the app, example application description, and FAQs
# - Attack tree visualisation using Mermaid.js (experimental)
# - Support for the latest 0613 versions of the GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models

    Act as a cyber security expert with more than 20 years experience of using the STRIDE threat modelling methodology to produce comprehensive threat models for a wide range of applications. Your task is to use the application description provided to you to produce a list of specific threats for the application. Your analysis should provide a credible scenario in which each threat could occur in the context of the application. It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details you are given.

    In addition to the description, you will be provided with the following key details about the application that you will need to consider when producing your threat model:
    - The type of application
    - The methods used to authenticate users to the application
    - Whether or not the application is internet-facing
    - Whether or not the application processes sensitive data
    - Whether or not the application uses privileged access management to protect privileged accounts

    Below is the application description and key details:
    APPLICATION TYPE: {app_type}
    AUTHENTICATION METHODS: {authentication}
    INTERNET FACING: {internet_facing}
    SENSITIVE DATA: {sensitive_data}
    PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT: {pam}
    APPLICATION DESCRIPTION: {app_input}

    Your output should be in the form of a markdown table with the following columns:
    - Column A: Threat Type
    - Column B: Scenario
    - Column C: Potential Impact
    
    In addition to the table you should also make some suggestions to the user on how they can improve the application description to enable you to produce a more comprehensive threat model.

    {{

        "improvement_suggestions": "YOUR IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS HERE"

    Act as a cyber security expert with more than 20 years experience of creating attack trees to communicate the likely routes by which systems and applications will be attacked by adversaries. Your task is to use the application description provided to you to generate an attack tree for the application. Your analysis should be based on credible attack types that could occur given the context of the application. It is very important that your responses are tailored to reflect the details you are given.

    In addition to the description, you will be provided with the following key details about the application that you will need to consider when producing the attack tree:
    - The type of application
    - The methods used to authenticate users to the application
    - Whether or not the application is internet-facing
    - Whether or not the application processes sensitive data

    INTERNET FACING: {internet_facing}
    SENSITIVE DATA: {sensitive_data}
    PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT: {pam}
    APPLICATION DESCRIPTION: {app_input}

    Your output should be in the form of a JSON object that contains two key-value pairs. The first key is 'mermaid_code' which should contain a string of valid Mermaid code that represents an attack tree. Mermaid is a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via JavaScript.

    IMPORTANT: When generating Mermaid code, you MUST ALWAYS enclose the node and link labels in double quotation marks to escape any special characters. For example:
    ```
    graph TD
    A["Attacker"] -->|"Phishing attack"| B["User's credentials"]
    A -->|"Cross-site scripting (XSS)"| F["User's session"]
    A -->|"Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)"| G["User's session"]
    A -->|"Server-side request forgery (SSRF)"| H["Server resources"]
    ```
    
    The second key-value pair is 'improvement_suggestions' and it should contain some suggestions to the user on how they can improve the application description to enable you to produce a more comprehensive and accurate attack tree.

    YOUR RESPONSE:
    {{
        "mermaid_code": `YOUR MERMAID CODE HERE`,

    ### **What is SimpliMediate?**
    STRIDE is a threat modeling methodology that helps to identify and categorise potential security risks in software applications. It stands for **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation Disclosure, **D**enial of Service, and **E**levation of Privilege.
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    ### **How does STRIDE GPT work?**
    When you enter an application description and other relevant details, the tool will use a GPT-3 model to generate a threat model for your application. The model uses the application description and details to generate a list of potential threats and then categorises each threat according to the STRIDE methodology.
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    ### **Do you store the application details provided?**
    No, STRIDE GPT does not store your application description or other details. All entered data is deleted after you close the browser tab.
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    ### **Why does it take so long to generate a threat model?**
 s   If you are using a free OpenAI API key, it will take a while to generate a threat model. This is because the free API key has strict rate limits. To speed up the process, you can use a paid API key.
    """)
    st.markdown("""
    ### **Are the threat models 100% accurate?**
    No, the threat models are not 100% accurate. STRIDE GPT uses GPT Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate its output. The GPT models are powerful, but they sometimes makes mistakes and are prone to 'hallucinations' (generating irrelevant or inaccurate content). Please use the output only as a starting point for identifying and addressing potential security risks in your applications.

    ### **How can I improve the accuracy of the threat models?**
    You can improve the accuracy of the threat models by providing a detailed description of the application and selecting the correct application type, authentication methods, and other relevant details. The more information you provide, the more accurate the threat models will be.
